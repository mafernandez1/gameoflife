# Assumptions

- Is a console application developed using Java and NetBeans
- The grid could be MxN
- If the user decides to set the seed the grid will be set alive cells in random positions
- Some tests were carried out using the following web page [The Game of Life](https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/ ) using the *10 Cell Row* option in the combobox.

# Test
The file called *CellGridTest.java* has three test scenarios:
- All cells are dead when the grid are initialised
- Game of life using the initial state of *10 Cell Row*
- Game of life using the initial state provided as an example in the attached document (Scenario 6).
